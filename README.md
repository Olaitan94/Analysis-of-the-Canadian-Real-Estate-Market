# Project Motivation 
The canadian real estate market has been a topic of news for a couple of years due to to the hike in prices. 

For this project, I was interested in analysing the real estate market in the major cities in the Prairies & West Coast Regions of Canada and answering the following questions: 

- **How effective has the increase in mortgage rate been in crashing the market?**
- **What cities (in the Prairie & West Coast region had the highest demand?**
- **Where would you advise someone with limited funds to buy a house?**
- **How well can we predict the price of a house?**

# Data
To answer these questions, I obtained the following data:
   - Houses sold in Major cities in the Prairie & West Coast regions from **Sept 25, 2022 to January 23, 2023**. (*Source: honestdoor.ca*)
   - Population of major cities in the Prairie & West Coast regions in 2021 (*Source: Wikipedia*)
