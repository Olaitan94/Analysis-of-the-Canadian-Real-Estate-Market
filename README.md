# Analysis-of-the-Canadian-Real-Estate-Market
Analysing the trends in the canadian real estatemarket from October 2022 to january 2023

## Project Motivation 
The canadian real estate market has been a hot topic of news since 2021 due to the hike in prices of properties. One of the approaches to crash the prices was increase in mortgage rates. But has this actually been effective or are the prices still on the rise? 

For this project, I was interested in analysing the real estate market in the major cities (population of over 200,000) in the Prairies & West Coast Regions of Canada to answer the following questions: 

- **How effective has the increase in mortgage rate been in crashing the market?**
- **What cities had the highest demand?**
- **Where would you advise someone with limited funds to buy a house?**
- **How well can we predict the price of a house?**

## Data
To answer these questions, I obtained the following data:
   - Houses sold in Major cities in the Prairie & West Coast regions from **Sept 25, 2022 to January 23, 2023**. (*Source: scraped from honestdoor.ca*) 
      -Major cities include: Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Burnaby, Surrey, Regina, Saskatoon
   - Population of major cities in the Prairie & West Coast regions in 2021 (*Source: Wikipedia*)
   - 5 - year fixed mortgage rates from September to January (*Source: ycharts.com*)
